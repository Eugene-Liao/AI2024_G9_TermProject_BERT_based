# AI2024_TermProject
## Brief Description
This is the term project of Group 9 for the AI-2024 course in NTU. This repo contains the code of the BERT-based approach for the fake/ robotic account by the posts/tweets contextual features. We tried different approaches to two datasets: TwiBot-20 and Weibo (this dataset consists of collected data from the Weibo platform)
